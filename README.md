This is a course of the Johannes Kepler University lectured in the summer semester in 2024.

## Course description
You can find the course description [here](https://studienhandbuch.jku.at/detail.php?lang=en&klaId=289SEECADSP20).
| Topic | Description |
|--|--|
| Objectives |  Embedded computer systems are increasingly becoming a key element of mechatronic systems. In recent years, these systems need to communicate with higher-level computer systems and with each other. In this practical course the contents of the lecture will be strengthened and applied in practice by means of exercises. |
| Subject | - Debugging with JTAG <br> - Adressing peripheral units (ADC,DCA, GPIO) <br> - Configuration and use of Direct Memory Access (DMA) <br> - Use of timers to output PWM-signals <br> - Interrupt Handling <br> - Real-time multitasking <br> - Communication via UART and SPI <br> - Communication with higher-level units (e.g. means of MQTT) |

3 ECTS and English
